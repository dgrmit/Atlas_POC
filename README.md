# Atlas_POC
My final year Honours research project, where I developed a proof of concept which demonstrates a suitable approach for creating 
a WebGL based virtual globe which can facilitate the navigation of digital atlas maps. The proof of concept also demonstrates a 
new method for transforming a section of a virtual globe into a 2D atlas map, via the use of selectable regions on the globeâ€™s 
surface and linear interpolation.
